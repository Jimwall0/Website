                    <p class="text">Hello my name is Tsim Muaj Yang. I’m a prospective dev that's trying to make headway in the tech industry. The first thing that interested me in the industry was gaming development. Like any other gamers out there, making your own game will always be a good goal to work towards. As I learned more about the tech industry I got more interested in both software and hardware. Currently I attend Atlas School which is a tech school that teaches students through project based learning. I’m enrolled in their full stack dev program. While there I have designed websites using base html and css. Learned tech stacks like bootstrap, tailwind, and MySQL. I have also touched python, C, and javascript for more general computer science based projects. For any business inquiries you can find me on my social or contact page.</p>

                        <p>This project was was a final prjoct for one of the trimesters while I was attending Atlas school. This website is hosted on github and was made to showcase what we learned throughout the year. On this one we had to partner up with someone and got to design a website based of music. We decided to make a spotify playlist that can be added to by anyone that visits the site. Check it out here <a href="https://github.com/Jimwall0/Final-Project-Music-">github</a></a></p>

                        <p>This prjoct was a backend project. There is not a lot of visual things going on in here. The goal of this project was to translate three different database on the internet into one database. It contained the all the episodes that aired of Bob Ross. <a href="https://github.com/Jimwall0/atlas-the-joy-of-painting-api"></a></p>
