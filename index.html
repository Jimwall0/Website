                    <p class="text">Hello my name is Tsim Muaj Yang. I’m a prospective dev that's trying to make headway in the tech industry. The first thing that interested me in the industry was gaming development. Like any other gamers out there, making your own game will always be a good goal to work towards. As I learned more about the tech industry I got more interested in both software and hardware. Currently I attend Atlas School which is a tech school that teaches students through project based learning. I’m enrolled in their full stack dev program. While there I have designed websites using base html and css. Learned tech stacks like bootstrap, tailwind, and MySQL. I have also touched python, C, and javascript for more general computer science based projects. For any business inquiries you can find me on my social or contact page.</p>
